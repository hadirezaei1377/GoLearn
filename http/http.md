google.com is an address, in fact itis a label for IP, the google server is up on this IP and it is processing.
in first step this label be changed to an IP address that this process be done by using DNS.
after that whenever we enter this label, we directrly connect to IP without using DNS, 
its exactly like hashing.

http provides a standard for connecting to servers and take the request and response.
this standard is using for server and client.
it must listen on a port.

IP is like a building that has several windows for input and output.
it has default ports for example 80 used for http and 443 used for https.

every thing that we write as a developer by GO sits in server and based on whatever user entered process and returns related respons.

if we want to take this responses in UI for users we use temple for html.
