main function: 
The first thing the golang compiler looks for is the main function, in fact, the main function in Golang is the entry point of our software.
The Golang compiler knows this function well and calls it (the first thing that is called) and we don't need to call it.
So we should put other function calls of our program inside this function.
The things we put inside the main function are executed in order.
