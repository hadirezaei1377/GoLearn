Go divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations

+	Addition        	Adds together two values	              x + y	
-	Subtraction	        Subtracts one value from another	      x - y	
*	Multiplication   	Multiplies two values                  	  x * y	
/	Division	        Divides one value by another	          x / y	
%	Modulus         	Returns the division remainder	          x % y	
++	Increment	        Increases the value of a variable by 1    x++	
--	Decrement       	Decreases the value of a variable by 1    x--

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables

=	    x = 5	x = 5	
+=	    x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	    x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	    x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	    x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=   	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
&=	    x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	    x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	    x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

Note: The return value of a comparison is either true (1) or false (0).

==	Equal to	                x == y	
!=	Not equal	                x != y	
>	Greater than                x > y	
<	Less than	                x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	    x <= y

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values

&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	                  x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	              x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	      !(x < 5 && x < 10)
